# Grainger-All-seer

##Intro
For library-goers, Grainger Library could be a great place. But finding an unoccupied seat could be a major challenge. Thatâ€™s when I start to think: what if we could figure out whether empty seats are out there by merely opening an app?

##Our solutionThat is where neural network comes to our rescue. If we could find out which seats on a table are occupied given a photo of the table, we should be able to make sure which seats are taken in a hall given a photo of the hall. So we trained a neural network to do just that. 

##Work Flow
Whenever a new photo is uploaded to our server, our well-trained neural network will take a guess based on the parameters from intensive trainning. After that, anyone who refresh the app could see the newly-updated seat distribution.

##Results
We are running a relatively small sample of only 143. However, its in-sample correct rate could be as high as 99%, while that of out-of-sample data could be above 70%. That's surprising enough since if it simply takes a wild guess, the probability is one out of sixteen.

##Usages 
Deploy the server according to the myServer folder.

The .m scripts could be run in both matlab and octave. Its prototype comes from Stanford Machine Learning on Coursera.
